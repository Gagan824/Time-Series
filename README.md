# Time-Series
Time Series using LSTM Model

## Forecasting is kind of prediction where we use to predict for the future date on the basis of hisyory data by taking some legs from history data.

#### Here We are performing Time Series forecasting using Stacked LSTM Model.

#### Model Architecture:

#### LSTM Layer -> LSTM Layer -> LSTM layer -> Dense Layer
